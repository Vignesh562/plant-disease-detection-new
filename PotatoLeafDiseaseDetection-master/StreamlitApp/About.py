        This project is designed to perform **real-time potato leaf disease detection** 
        using advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques. It incorporates 
        various features and functionalities to enhance the user experience and improve 
        the model's reliability. Below is a detailed explanation of each feature used in this project:

        - The system captures a live video feed from the webcam and processes each frame in real-time.
        - A **bounding box** dynamically highlights the region of the image being analyzed by the model.
        - The model runs predictions on each frame to classify the potato leaf as healthy or diseased.
        - Users can control the video feed using **Play**, **Pause**, and **Stop** buttons.

    st.subheader("üé• Camera Input")
    st.write("""
        - Users can capture an image of a potato leaf using their webcam.
        - The captured image is preprocessed and passed through three different models for predictions:
            - **Custom CNN Model**: A specialized model trained on the dataset.
            - **Inception Model**: A pre-trained InceptionV3 model fine-tuned for the task.
            - **ResNet Model**: A pre-trained ResNet50 model fine-tuned for the task.
        - The predictions from all three models, along with their confidence scores, are displayed for comparison.

        - Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) is used to visualize which regions of the leaf 
          the model focuses on for its predictions.
        - While real-time Grad-CAM overlays can slow down video processing, this feature is critical 
          for understanding model behavior.
        - The **bounding box** is dynamically calculated based on the heatmap regions, helping users 
          identify the model's area of focus.

        - A **bounding box** dynamically highlights the region of the potato leaf where the 
          model focuses its analysis.

          to the most activated regions in the image.
